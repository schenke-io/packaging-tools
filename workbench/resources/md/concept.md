## Concept

This package follows the following concept:
- setup and configuration is controlled by a config file
- manual edits have higher priority than automatics
- when manual edits would be overwritten there is a warning
- the documentation is organised out of components which get assembled at the end 
- important classes and methods are marked and documented
- badges are written from data 
- the build process is controlled by script
- missing files are explained with full path
