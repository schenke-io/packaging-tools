This package is a collection of tools to simplify the package and project development.

The main elements are:
- **Markdown** Assemble the readme.md file out of small markdown files, class comments and other sources
- **Badge** build the badge custom or from existing files
- **Setup** read the `.packaging-tools.neon` configuration file and modify scripts in `composer.json`
- **Boost Skills & Guidelines** this package supports the [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/boost) standard for AI-ready packages.

### Skill-based documentation

Documentation for this package is partly generated from **AI Skills**. These skills are small, focused pieces of documentation that describe specific features or workflows. They are located in `resources/boost/skills/` and are also compatible with Laravel Boost.

By using these skills, the package ensures that both human developers and AI assistants have clear, actionable instructions on how to use the provided tools.
