This package is a collection of tools to simplify the package and project development.

The main elements are:
- **Markdown** Assemble the readme.md file out of small markdown files, class comments and other sources
- **Badge** build the badge custom or from existing files
- **Setup** read the `.packaging-tools.neon` configuration file and modify scripts in `composer.json`

## Installation

Install the package with composer:

```bash
  composer require schenke-io/packaging-tools
```

Add the setup command into `composer.json` under scripts.

```json
{
    
    
    "scripts": {
        "setup": "SchenkeIo\\PackagingTools\\Setup::handle"    
    }
    
}

```



Start the setup:

```bash
  composer setup
```

and check all available setup parameters:

```bash
  composer setup help
```





## Concept

This package follows the following concept:
- setup and configuration is controlled by a config file
- manual edits have higher priority than automatics
- when manual edita would be overwritten there is a warning
- the documentation is organised out of components which get assembled at the end 
- important classes and methods are marked and documented
- badges are written from data 
- the build process is controlled by script
- missing files are explained with full path






## Configuration

Each package is controlled by a config file
`.packaging-tools.neon` . NEON files can be
written as YAML or JSON but additionally with comments.

The format can be easily schema verified and is used here as simple
key-value-pairs.

## Classes




### MarkdownAssembler

Assembler of a markdown file



#### How to assemble a markdown

To assemble a markdown you need these things:
- a directory with well named markdown files
- documentation of classes and methods
- csv files for tables 
- a script
  - which writes badges
  - which read and assemble these files

This script can be a script run by php itself or 
a class file with a static method.




```php
<?php


require "vendor/autoload.php";

use SchenkeIo\PackagingTools\Markdown\MarkdownAssembler;

/*
 * this scripts make the package itself and tests its functionality
 */

try {
    $mda = new MarkdownAssembler(/* subdirectory for markdown include files */);
    $mda->addMarkdown(/* relative to markdown directory */);
    $mda->addTableOfContents();
    // relative to markdown directory
    $mda->addMarkdown("installation.md");
    // makes markdown from a class phpdoc
    $mda->addClassMarkdown(MarkdownAssembler::class);

    // path relative to root directory
    $mda->writeMarkdown("README.md");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "ERROR: " . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}




```

#### Details of addTableFromFile()

The following extensions for the file are implemented: 

| Extension | Delimiter | Details             |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| *.csv     | ,         | comma seperated     |
| *.psv     | \|        | pipe seperated      |
| *.tsv     | \t        | tabulator seperated |

#### Details of addTableFromArray()

The array is expected to have this format:

```php
$arary = [
    ['header 1','header 2','header 3'],
    ['cell 1:1','cell 1:2','cell 1:3'],
    ['cell 2:1','cell 2:2','cell 2:3'],
    ['cell 3:1','cell 3:2','cell 3:3'],
];

```

and would be rendered like this:

| header 1 | header 2 | header 3 |  
|----------|----------|----------|
| cell 1:1 | cell 1:2 | cell 1:3 |
| cell 2:1 | cell 2:2 | cell 2:3 |
